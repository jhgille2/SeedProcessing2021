# Seed Processing 2021

This repo is a workflow that (mostly) automates the file management and data analysis for our 2021 growing/2022 seed processing season. It uses functions from the [snfR](https://github.com/jhgille2/snfR) package I'm working on to help to simplify things. Probably the best way to use this repo is to clone it into RStudio like is described [in sections 16.1 and 16.2 here](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first.html). Then, run the code in the packages.R file and run tar_make() in the console. You can also see a visualization of the workflow by running tar_visnetwork() in the console.
