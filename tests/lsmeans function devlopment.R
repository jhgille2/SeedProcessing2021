# Start with the data that has already been pivoted by phenotype, test,
# and location

tar_load(pivoted_phenotype_data)

# Ultimately, we want both within, and across location LSMeans.
# This means that we'll need to fit a linear model for each test, trait, and location
# combination. And a mixed effects model for each test and trait combination. These
# two models are formulated as....
#
# linear (within location): phenotype ~ genotype + rep
# mixed (across location) : phenotype ~ genotype + (1|loc/rep) + (1|loc:genotype)
#
# A short note: The specification of the mixed model means that genotype will be considered
# a fixed effect while location and rep are considered to be random effects.
# A random effect is specified by putting it within the parentheses after the "(1|".
# Furthermore, (1|loc/rep) is shorthand for fitting random effects for both
# location  as well as the interaction of location with rep. Put another way, in long form,
# the model can also be written as...
#
# phenotype ~ genotype + (1|loc) + (1|loc:rep) + (1|loc:genotype)
